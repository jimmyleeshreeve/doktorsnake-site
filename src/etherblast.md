# EtherBlast

<p class="text"><strong>Precision influence. One outcome. Decisive movement.</strong></p>

When a situation is stuck, it is usually because **one key factor** is holding everything in place — a person, a decision, a financial bottleneck, a pressure point you can’t quite reach directly.

**EtherBlast is focused influence applied exactly where it matters most.**

This is not a general blessing or a vague intention.<br />
It is a **targeted working** designed to shift one specific condition that is blocking progress.

-----

### When EtherBlast Is the Right Tool

EtherBlast works best when the issue is clear and defined. For example:

* Removing pressure, interference, or crossed conditions
* Opening financial flow or a specific opportunity
* Quieting a rival, hostile influence, or obstructive personality
* Supporting health and vitality during a difficult phase
* Stabilising a strained relationship dynamic
* Clearing persistent negativity or draining environments
* Boosting luck and alignment around a key event or decision

One focus. One direction. One shift.

### How the Working Is Done

Your intention is carried into focused trance work carried out at power-ground sites in the East of England — places where the signal is quiet and the field is strong.

There, the situation is held in awareness, aligned, and pushed in the chosen direction. The aim is not spectacle, but **measurable movement in the real world**.

---

### After You Book

1. You describe the situation and the **one outcome** you want to influence

2. The working is scheduled and carried out

3. You receive a written report outlining:
  * What was done
  * What arose during the working
  * Any practical guidance for maintaining momentum

---

### Scope

EtherBlast is designed for:

* **One clearly defined intention**
* A single, focused influence operation
* Situations that need a **precise adjustment**, not a full overhaul

If your situation involves multiple interlocking problems, a higher tier may be more effective.
