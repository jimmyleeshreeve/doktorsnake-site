# EtherBlast

## Single-Vector Influence

One focused intention. One decisive strike into the field.

EtherBlast is the cleanest entry point when **one problem rises above all others** — money pressure, interference, protection, love turbulence, a career block, a high-stakes moment.

This is not theatre. It is **applied influence**: targeted, discreet, and built to create movement.

> When you can name the *one thing* that must shift, EtherBlast is the correct tool.

---

## Best For

- A single clear outcome you want turned in your favour  
- A stuck situation that needs momentum  
- Crossing conditions, heaviness, pressure, interference  
- A deadline moment where luck and timing matter

## What Gets Done

### The Working

I enter trance, tune into the situation, and push a single intention into the field with targeted force.

You receive:

- a scheduled working date  
- a concise post-working report (what was done + what surfaced)  
- a simple follow-through instruction (one action you can do to reinforce the vector)  

<p class="note">You don’t need belief. You need a clear outcome.</p>

---

## Operational Sequence

1. **You send a concise briefing**  
   Situation, desired outcome, and any timing pressure.

2. **I confirm fit and timing**  
   If the tier isn’t right, I’ll recommend the correct level before payment.

3. **The working is carried out**  
   Quietly, privately, and without ongoing demands on your time.

4. **You receive a short report**  
   What was done, what surfaced, and one follow-through instruction if needed.

<p class="note">This work is practical. It does not require belief, ritual participation, or lifestyle changes.</p>

## Operational Notes

### How fast do results show?
Some shifts happen quickly. Others unfold as obstacles clear and new pathways open. Think in terms of **movement**, not spectacle.

### Do you need personal details or photos?
No. A clear description of the situation is enough. Only share what feels relevant and appropriate.

### What if I’m unsure which tier fits?
Send the situation anyway. I’ll recommend the cleanest and most efficient level before anything proceeds.

### Is this therapy, coaching, or fortune-telling?
No. This is applied influence work focused on shifting real-world conditions.
