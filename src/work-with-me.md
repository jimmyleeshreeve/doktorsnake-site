# Work With Me

I work with individuals who want **clarity, leverage, and movement** in real situations — career, money, decisions, direction, and complex life transitions.

> You don’t need to believe in anything. You need a situation that needs shifting.

---

## Two Ways We Work Together

### Influence Workings  
**When something external needs to move**

- Career blocks and stalled opportunities  
- Financial stagnation or pressure  
- Relationship tension or interference  
- Hostile or draining environments  
- Situations with deadlines and high stakes

### Dokology  
**When *you* need sharper perception, control, and strategic thinking**

- Recurring life patterns that keep repeating  
- Emotional turbulence or mental overwhelm  
- Overthinking, internal noise, or indecision  
- Leadership under pressure  
- High-stakes decision environments

## Levels of Influence Working

| Tier | Best For | Style |
|------|---------|-------|
| **EtherBlast** | One focused situation | Precise, fast, direct |
| **MegaBlast** | Interlinked issues | Layered, multi-vector |
| **GigaBlast** | Major life pivot | Deep, strategic field shift |

> If you’re unsure which tier fits, describe the situation and I’ll advise.

## Dokology — The Internal Advantage

Dokology is not a one-off reading.  
It is a structured way of developing perception, composure, and decision-making clarity over time.

It helps you:

- Interrupt mental loops  
- Regain emotional control under pressure  
- Think clearly in complex environments  
- Make high-stakes decisions with less noise  
- Shift from reaction to strategy

## Best Fit Clients

This work is best suited to:

- Entrepreneurs and independent professionals  
- People navigating complex life transitions  
- Individuals with high responsibility or decision pressure  
- Those open to unconventional frameworks  
- People who want **results**, not comfort stories  

> This is not entertainment. This is applied work.

## Entry Point

If you’re unsure whether you need Dokology or an influence working first, send:

- what’s happening  
- what outcome you want  
- any deadline  

I’ll recommend the cleanest starting point.
