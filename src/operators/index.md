## Operator Lexicon — Signal Edition

A quiet page for those who notice things.

The Edge Cult doesn’t use slogans or tired tribal language. Operators speak in signal, not slang. If you’ve found this page, you’re already inside the layer.

<p class="text">Below is a small extraction from the Operator Lexicon — field terms for shaping the Simulation.</p>

<div class="card">

`01 // operator`

One who navigates the Simulation consciously.

`02 // the field`

The ambient layer of psychic-information we act upon.

`03 // the signal`

Clarity, intent, and the transmission of will.

`04 // the static`

Noise, confusion, emotional distortion. Cut it. Move through.

`05 // resonance`

Alignment between intent and the field.

`06 // the layer`

A sub-zone of the Simulation where influence manifests.

`07 // vector`

Direction or method of influence.

`08 // strike`

A precise action into the field. A psychological or magical incision.

`09 // echo`

The after-effect of an operation.

`10 // the architecture`

The underlying machinery of reality. Sometimes it bends.

`11 // null zone`

The moment before the move. No-mind. No drag. Pure signal.

Nothing here is final. The lexicon shifts as the field shifts. Operators refine the code as they move.

If you landed here, consider it your first signal.
