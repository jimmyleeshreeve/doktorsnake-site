# GigaBlast

<p class="text"><strong>Full-field influence. Deep realignment. Strategic movement.</strong></p>

Some situations cannot be solved by adjusting a few surface elements. The issue isn’t just one event or one relationship — it’s the **overall pattern** holding things in place.

**GigaBlast is a full-field working** designed to influence the wider structure around your situation, not just the visible symptoms.

This is for times when you need **substantial movement**, not a minor correction.

---

### When GigaBlast Is the Right Tool

GigaBlast is suited to major turning points and entrenched situations, such as:

* Career crossroads where direction, environment, and opportunity must all shift
* Long-term stagnation that feels woven into multiple areas of life
* High-pressure periods involving legal, financial, or institutional forces
* Deep relationship patterns that keep repeating despite effort
* Life phases where “everything feels blocked” rather than one specific issue

Here, the aim is not just to influence events, but to **reshape the flow around the situation**.

### How the Working Is Done

GigaBlast involves extended trance engagement and broader field interaction than the other tiers. Instead of focusing on a single thread or a small group of threads, the **whole pattern surrounding the situation** is held in awareness and influenced.

Work is carried out at power-ground sites in the East of England, where sustained focus allows deeper alignment and stronger directional influence.

The intention is to create a **shift in trajectory**, not just a short-term lift.

### After You Book

You describe the situation and the **key areas of life or circumstance** that need to change

1. The working is scheduled and carried out as a full-field operation
2. You receive a comprehensive written report outlining:

   * How the situation presented in the field
   * The main areas addressed during the working
   * Practical guidance for aligning with the new momentum

---

### Scope

GigaBlast is designed for:

* Situations involving **multiple intertwined factors**
* Broader life or career phases, not just isolated events
* Clients who want **deeper engagement and wider influence**

This is the highest level of working offered outside of ongoing Dokology or longer-term consultation.
