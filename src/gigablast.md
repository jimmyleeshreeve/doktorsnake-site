# GigaBlast

## Strategic Field Operation

When it’s not “a problem.”  
It’s a **pivot**.

Use GigaBlast for major turning points: exits, reinventions, relocations, high-stakes career arcs, institutional/legal pressure, or entrenched conditions that resist simpler interventions.

EtherBlast is a strike.  
MegaBlast is a coordinated push.  
GigaBlast is a campaign.

> If the situation requires a new timeline, GigaBlast is the correct instrument.

## Best For

- Major life pivot (career, location, relationship, identity)  
- Long-running block that won’t release  
- Institutional / legal / bureaucratic pressure  
- Complex situations with multiple actors and constraints  

---

## What You Receive

- Briefing alignment (so the objective is clean)  
- Confirmed working window for the operation  
- A post-working report (field data + guidance)  
- A reinforcement instruction (one follow-through protocol)  

<p class="note">GigaBlast is designed for leverage and release — not wishful thinking.</p>

---

## Operational Sequence

1. **You send a concise briefing**  
   Situation, desired outcome, and any timing pressure.

2. **I confirm fit and timing**  
   If the tier isn’t right, I’ll recommend the correct level before payment.

3. **The working is carried out**  
   Quietly, privately, and without ongoing demands on your time.

4. **You receive a short report**  
   What was done, what surfaced, and one follow-through instruction if needed.

<p class="note">This work is practical. It does not require belief, ritual participation, or lifestyle changes.</p>

## Operational Notes

### How fast do results show?
Some shifts happen quickly. Others unfold as obstacles clear and new pathways open. Think in terms of **movement**, not spectacle.

### Do you need personal details or photos?
No. A clear description of the situation is enough. Only share what feels relevant and appropriate.

### What if I’m unsure which tier fits?
Send the situation anyway. I’ll recommend the cleanest and most efficient level before anything proceeds.

### Is this therapy, coaching, or fortune-telling?
No. This is applied influence work focused on shifting real-world conditions.
