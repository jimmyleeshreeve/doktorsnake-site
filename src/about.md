     alt="Doktor Snake — strategic influence and perceptual systems">

Doktor Snake is the working identity of Jimmy Lee Shreeve — a British author and former investigative journalist.

His work has appeared in:

- The Independent  
- The Daily Telegraph  
- The Sunday Telegraph  
- The Financial Times  
- The Daily Express  
- And other publications in the UK and United States  

Before operating independently, he wrote on complex subjects where psychology, power, belief systems, and institutional structures intersect.

Over time, commentary evolved into application.

Not theory.  
Not narrative.  
Direct strategic work.

Jimmy Lee Shreeve is the author of:

- *Blood Rites* (Random House)  
- *Cannibals*  
- *How To Be Famous*  
- *Hash Brownies* (as Dr Hash)

## Apprenticeship & Influence

In the 1980s he was mentored by Earl Marlowe — a Trinidadian hoodoo practitioner and world music singer — who framed magic and psychology as two languages describing the same mechanism.

That early training combined with journalistic discipline led to a lifelong interest in:

- Perception under pressure  
- Attention control  
- Strategic framing  
- Influence in complex systems  

---

## Today

Operating from Suffolk, England — a landscape dense with ancient sites and historical strata — he translates those principles into modern tools for:

- Clarity  
- Leverage  
- Timing  
- Self-command  

The work does not require belief.

It requires a situation that needs movement.
