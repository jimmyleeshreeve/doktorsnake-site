# MegaBlast

## Multi-Vector Influence

Three intentions. One coordinated operation.

MegaBlast is for situations where **everything is connected**: money + career + interference, love + pressure + timing, or “one person causes three problems.”

EtherBlast is a single strike.  
MegaBlast is a **multi-vector push**.

> If the situation has more than one moving part, you don’t want a single lever. You want a coordinated set.

---

## Best For

- Three linked outcomes (example: *money flow* + *career opening* + *protection*)  
- Complex relationship dynamics (third-party interference, destabilising influence)  
- Multiple pressures converging (work, legal, family, health stress)  
- A “messy field” where clarity and momentum must be restored

## What Gets Done

### The Working

I build a three-intention structure and run it as a coordinated operation: stabilise, clear resistance, push movement.

You receive:

- confirmed timing window  
- a post-working report (what was done + what surfaced)  
- follow-through instruction (simple reinforcement action)  

<p class="note">MegaBlast is built for situations with cross-talk — where one change affects the others.</p>

---

## Operational Sequence

1. **You send a concise briefing**  
   Situation, desired outcome, and any timing pressure.

2. **I confirm fit and timing**  
   If the tier isn’t right, I’ll recommend the correct level before payment.

3. **The working is carried out**  
   Quietly, privately, and without ongoing demands on your time.

4. **You receive a short report**  
   What was done, what surfaced, and one follow-through instruction if needed.

<p class="note">This work is practical. It does not require belief, ritual participation, or lifestyle changes.</p>

## Operational Notes

### How fast do results show?
Some shifts happen quickly. Others unfold as obstacles clear and new pathways open. Think in terms of **movement**, not spectacle.

### Do you need personal details or photos?
No. A clear description of the situation is enough. Only share what feels relevant and appropriate.

### What if I’m unsure which tier fits?
Send the situation anyway. I’ll recommend the cleanest and most efficient level before anything proceeds.

### Is this therapy, coaching, or fortune-telling?
No. This is applied influence work focused on shifting real-world conditions.
