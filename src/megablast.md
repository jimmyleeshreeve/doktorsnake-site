# MegaBlast

<p class="text"><strong>Multi-vector influence. Coordinated movement. Structural change.</strong></p>

Some situations don’t shift because several elements are locked together — people, pressure, money, timing, emotional charge. Adjusting just one factor isn’t enough.

**MegaBlast works across multiple pressure points at once**, creating movement where a single intervention would stall.

This is a coordinated operation, not a single strike.

### When MegaBlast Is the Right Tool

MegaBlast is suited to situations where problems are *interconnected*, for example:

* Career blockage tied to rivalry, confidence, and stalled opportunity
* Relationship strain combined with outside interference and miscommunication
* Financial pressure linked to work conditions and hidden resistance
* Legal or institutional stress with multiple moving parts
* Long-running stagnation where energy feels “held in place”

Here, change requires **shifting the pattern**, not just nudging one event.

### How the Working Is Done

MegaBlast involves deeper trance engagement and broader field work than EtherBlast. Instead of focusing on one thread, multiple connected threads are held and influenced together.

The aim is to create **momentum across the situation as a whole**, so movement in one area supports movement in the others.

Workings are carried out at quiet, power-ground locations, where sustained focus and layered intention can be applied without distraction.

### After You Book

1. You outline the situation and up to **three linked outcomes** you want to influence
2. The working is scheduled and carried out as a single coordinated operation
3. You receive a detailed report covering:

   * How the threads of the situation appeared in the field
   * What adjustments were made
   * Practical guidance to help you work with the shifting momentum

If your situation calls for full life-pattern realignment, GigaBlast may be more appropriate.
