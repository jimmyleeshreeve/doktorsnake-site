# Readings

A reading is a focused look at your situation — what’s really going on, what matters, what doesn’t, and what move changes the game.

This isn’t fortune-telling, and it isn’t emotional reassurance.

Think of it more like a high-signal briefing: pattern recognition, hidden dynamics, timing, and the simplest next action that produces maximum effect.

  <h3>What a Reading Is Good For</h3>

  - Relationship dynamics and mixed signals  
  - Work, power politics, rivals, and leverage  
  - Money flow, blockages, and opportunity windows  
  - Situations that feel “off” but you can’t quite see why  
  - Decision points where the stakes feel real

## How I Work

You describe the situation in plain language.  
I step back, look at the patterns, and give you a clear interpretation of what’s happening and where the real pressure points are.

Sometimes the framing is psychological.  
Sometimes strategic.  
Sometimes symbolic or mythic — if that lens reveals more than straight logic alone.

The aim is always the same: **clarity you can act on.**

## A Note on “Divination”

The only so-called divining tool I ever genuinely liked was the I Ching — not because it predicts the future, but because its meanings are deliberately open enough to behave like Schrödinger’s Cat: possibilities exist until the right mind engages and collapses them into relevance.

That’s the spirit of these readings.

We’re not chasing certainty.  
We’re extracting signal from noise, so you can choose your next move with your eyes open.
